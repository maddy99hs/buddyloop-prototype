BuddyLoop – Buddy Matching Prototype
A front-end prototype that matches newcomers with different kinds of “buddies” (cultural, city, daily life, university) to reduce social isolation.


Context:
This app is built for the Design Thinking Intercontinental COIL Program (international collab, social isolation challenge).
- Many newcomers feel lost in their first weeks in a new city or country. BuddyLoop explores how structured buddy roles can make the transition less overwhelming.

Features:
- Choose from 4 buddy programs: Cultural, City, Daily Life, University.
- Simple wizard-style flow: Home → Programs → Program detail → “Get matched” form → Matches.
- Safety messaging (public meetups, no money handling, no legal/medical advice).
- Prototype-only: UI works, but no real backend / requests.

Tech stack: HTML, CSS, vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks).
